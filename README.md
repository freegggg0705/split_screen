The problem here initally thought as CORS problem but indeed unlike rss reader which the problem of accessing files mainly from CORS, this time iframe got problem by x-framer. Bypassing addon work well too but initially my code got so much complicated by adding many layers by grok to bypass instead of using simple addon to perform such due to the fact that it wants the script to be self contained. This would be a big problem for vibe coding and truly, one level up operation here cannot be coded by Ai and can only be figured out by human.
